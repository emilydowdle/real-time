## Real Time Feedback

Real Time Feedback is a live polling app. Create a poll with up to three options, send the link to your friends and watch the votes roll in.

#### Features

* **Real-time voting:** You don't have to wait for an email or click refresh. Votes are tallied and displayed as they are cast.
* **Pre-determined runtime:** Don't want your poll to live on forever? Simply enter the number of minutes you'd like your poll to be live for. The poll will automatically close once the set time has past.
* **Real-time chatting:** You, the admin, can send and receive messages from the entire group of voters. When someone enters a question or comment, it's displayed to everyone.
